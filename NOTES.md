1. Is the feature request clear? Did you feel like you needed more information?
It is tough to follow what the base price of a sandwich was as opposed to a topping. Setting up the base math for a sandwich could have been implemented from the beginning saving us all time! The 'Other Sandwich' tab is not explicitly mentioned, i suppose to measure our attention to detail.

 
2. Is there anything you would have done differently if you had more time or resources?
More tests. Always more tests. Though I did find it refreshing that your team doesn't write view layer tests, recognizing that view tests, while important for code coverage at times, do not meaningfully contribute to your suite of unit tests like a function test does.

3. How could the code be structured differently to be easier to work with?
Fewer JSON configuration based options, though I understand the convenience of having a simple JSON to go in and edit.

4. Is there anything else you think we should know?
